# 1. Web Scraping Framework 

### Scapy 
__Advs:__
* an asynchronous web scraping framework
* very efficient (both computationally and in space) and flexible 
* similar to Django

__Disadv:__
* not very beginner-friendly 


### Other Python Scraping Tools 
* `urllib2` `requests` : not a complete web scraping solution; only for reading and opening web pages 
* `beautiful soup` `lxml` : only for extracting data points from loaded pages; beautiful soup is handy when HTML is poorly formatted; LXML for processing XML,HTML is very space efficient and fast 
* `selenium` : a tool for writing automated tests of web applications; handles JS-heavy websites
