### Source Code

### Why/When to use Selenium 
* Selenium is mainly used for writing automated tests for web applications. That said, it is also used for web scraping mainly because easy for beginners and it is suitable for scraping JavaScript driven web pages, especially if JavaScript interactions are very complex with many get and post requests. 
* So we can use Selenium iterate on JavaScript driven web pages and then use Scrapy Selectors to scrape the HTML that Selenium produces. 
* That said, Scraping thousand pages with Scrapy is 20 times faster than using Selenium. Furthermore, Scrapy consumes a lot less memory, and CPU usage than Selenium. 
* You also need a “driver”, which is a small program that allows Selenium to “drive” your browser. This driver is browser-specific, so first we need to choose which browser we want to use. For this course, we will use Chrome, precisely ChromeDriver.
